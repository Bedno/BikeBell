"Virtual Bike Bell" web-app gives an array of great sounds on bike speakers.

Play now at https://bedno.com/bike/bell

Tap to play selected sound, more taps to restart it.  Selector picks other sounds, links appear for recent ones.

Ideal for bicyles already carrying a bluetooth speaker and phone mount, simplifying one item off the handlebars.

Can be dropped on phone's home screen from a browser to appear as an app and potentially be available even offline.

All sounds from public domain sources then heavily processed to maximize volume.

Current sounds: RingRing, Beep, Bong, Boo, Bugle, Caw, Charge, Cheers, Fail, Falling, Photon, Police, Rescue, Ring, Rooster, Shofar, Smash, Steam, Traffic, Train, Whistle, Wrong, Xylophone

Planned sounds: French Siren.  Random pick.  Downsample the sounds to reduce file sizes even more.

Consider adding speech features: Fortune selection which speaks one of the famed eightball answers.  Dice selection which speaks a number one through six.  Twister selection speaks one of the 16 moves.

Install locally by placing all files in same directory and launching index.htm

On PCs all sounds should pre-load.  On mobile the browser blocks download until user interaction.  But after the first play of any sound, future uses of it should be instantaneous.
